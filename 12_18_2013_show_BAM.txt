================ CHUNK 1   ================ 
  
 HAMLET 
 O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, 
 Thaw and resolve itself into a dew! 
 Or that the Everlasting had not fixed 
 His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God! 
 How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, 
 Seem to me all the uses of this world! 
 Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden, 
 That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature 
 Possess it merely. That it should come to this!

 GHOST 
 My hour is almost come, 
 When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames 
 Must render up myself. 
 HAMLET 
 Alas, poor ghost! 
 GHOST

 ( entrance Enter OPHELIA.) 
================ CHUNK 1 ActTwoSceneOne  ================ 
  
 OPHELIA 
 O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted! 
 POLONIUS 
 With what, i' the name of God? 
 OPHELIA 
 My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, 
 Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced; 
 No hat upon his head; his stockings fouled, 
 Ungartered, and down-gyved to his ankle; 
 Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other; 
 And with a look so piteous in purport 
 As if he had been loosed out of hell 
 To speak of horrors, he comes before me. 

================ CHUNK 1 ActTwoSceneTwo  ================

 ( place A room in the castle.)

 GUILDENSTERN 
 My honoured lord! 
 ROSENCRANTZ 
 My most dear lord! 
 HAMLET 
 My excellent good friends! 
 How dost thou, Guildenstern? 
 Ah, Rosencrantz! 
 Good lads, how do you both? 
 ROSENCRANTZ 
 As the indifferent children of the earth. 
 GUILDENSTERN 
 Happy, in that we are not overhappy; 
 On fortune's cap we are not the very button. 
 HAMLET 
 Nor the soles of her shoe? 
 ROSENCRANTZ 
 Neither, my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours? 
 GUILDENSTERN 
 'Faith, her privates we. 
 HAMLET 
 In the secret parts of fortune? 
 O, most true; 
 she is a strumpet. 
 What news? 
 ROSENCRANTZ 
 None, my lord, but the world's grown honest. 
 HAMLET 
 Then is doomsday near: 
 but your news is not true. 
 Let me question more in particular: 
 what have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune, 
 that she sends you to prison hither? 
 GUILDENSTERN 
 Prison, my lord! 
 HAMLET 
 Denmark's a prison. 
 ROSENCRANTZ 
 Then is the world one. 
 HAMLET 
 A goodly one; 
 in which there are many confines, wards and dungeons, 
 Denmark being one o' the worst. 

================ CHUNK 1 ActThreeSceneOne  ================ 
  Act 3, Scene 1 
 ( place A room in the castle.) 
================ CHUNK 1 ActThreeSceneOne  ================ 
  
 HAMLET 
 To be, or not to be: that is the question: 
 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, 
 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 
 And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; 
 No more; and by a sleep to say we end 
 The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks 
 That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation 
 Devoutly to be wished.

 HAMLET 
 Lady, shall I lie in your lap? 
 ( action Lying down at Ophelia's feet.) 
 OPHELIA 
 No, my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 I mean, my head upon your lap? 
 OPHELIA 
 Ay, my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 Do you think I meant country matters? 
 OPHELIA 
 I think nothing, my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs. 
 OPHELIA 
 What is, my lord? 
 HAMLET 
 Nothing. 
 OPHELIA 
 You are merry, my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 Who, I? 
 OPHELIA 
 Ay, my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 O God, your only jig-maker. 
 What should a man do but be merry? 
 for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, 
 and my father died within's two hours. 
 OPHELIA 
 Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 So long?

 HAMLET 
 Now, mother, what's the matter? 
 GERTRUDE 
 Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended. 
 HAMLET 
 Mother, you have my father much offended. 
 GERTRUDE 
 Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue. 
 HAMLET 
 Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue. 
 GERTRUDE 
 Why, how now, Hamlet! 
 HAMLET 
 What's the matter now?

 Pursued my life.

 Alas, poor Yorick! 
 I knew him, Horatio: 
 a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: 
 he hath bore me on his back a thousand times; 
 and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! 
 my gorge rises at it. 
 Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. 
 Where be your gibes now? 
 your gambols? 
 your songs? 
 your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar?

================ CHUNK 1 ActFiveSceneTwo  ================ 
  
 HAMLET 
 O, I die, Horatio; 
 The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit: 
 I cannot live to hear the news from England; 
 But I do prophesy the election lights 
 On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice; 
 So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less, 
 Which have solicited. The rest is silence. 
 ( action Dies.) 
 HORATIO 
 Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince; 
 And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
