 Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets: 
 As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, 
 Disasters in the sun; and the moist star 
 Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands 
 Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse: 
 And even the like precurse of feared events, 
 As harbingers preceding still the fates 
 And prologue to the omen coming on.
