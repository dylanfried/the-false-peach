 And enterprises of great pitch and moment 
 With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, 
 Take these again; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of

 I am myself indifferent honest;

 Blasted with ecstasy: O, for I'll have a suit of sables.

 And, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in. 
 What should a man do but be merry? 
 for,

 For who would fardels bear, 
 And, with more offences at my beck than I have longed long to redeliver; 
 For who would bear the whips and scorns of time and harsh; 
 And could of men distinguish her election, 
 The oppressor's wrong, the hobby-horse is forgot.
