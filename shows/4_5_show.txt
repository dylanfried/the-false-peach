 Long live the king! 
 FRANCISCO 
 Bernardo? 
 BERNARDO 
 He. 
 FRANCISCO

 ( sound Flourish.) 
 ( entrance Enter the KING, QUEEN, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND,)  
  ( entrance CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants.) 
 KING 
 Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death 
 The memory be green, and that it us befitted 
 To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom 
 To be contracted in one brow of woe, 
 Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature 
 That we with wisest sorrow think on him, 
 Together with remembrance of ourselves.
================ CHUNK 1   ================ 
  
 ( sound Flourish.) 
 ( exit Exeunt all but Hamlet.) 

================ CHUNK 1   ================ 
  
 HAMLET 
 O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, 
 Thaw and resolve itself into a dew! 
 Or that the Everlasting had not fixed 
 His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God! 
 How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, 
 Seem to me all the uses of this world! 
 Fie on't! ah fie!
================ CHUNK 1 ActOneSceneThree  ================ 
  Act 1, Scene 3 
 ( place A room in Polonius' house.) 
 ( entrance Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA.) 
 LAERTES 
 My necessaries are embarked: farewell: 
 And, sister, as the winds give benefit 
 And convey is assistant, do not sleep, 
 But let me hear from you. 
 OPHELIA 
 Do you doubt that? 
 LAERTES 
 For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour, 
 Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, 
 A violet in the youth of primy nature, 
 Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, 
 The perfume and suppliance of a minute; 
 No more.
================ CHUNK 1 ActOneSceneFive  ================ 
  Act 1, Scene 5 
 ( place Another part of the platform.) 
 ( entrance Enter GHOST and HAMLET.) 
 HAMLET 
 Whither wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further. 
 GHOST

 My hour is almost come, 
 When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames 
 Must render up myself. 
 HAMLET 
 Alas, poor ghost!

 ( exit Exit REYNALDO.) 
 ( entrance Enter OPHELIA.) 

================ CHUNK 1 ActTwoSceneOne  ================ 
  
 OPHELIA 
 O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted! 
 POLONIUS 
 With what, i' the name of God? 
 OPHELIA 
 My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, 
 Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced; 
 No hat upon his head; his stockings fouled, 
 Ungartered, and down-gyved to his ankle; 
 Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other; 
 And with a look so piteous in purport 
 As if he had been loosed out of hell 
 To speak of horrors, he comes before me. 
 POLONIUS 
 Mad for thy love? 
 OPHELIA 
 My lord, I do not know; 
 But truly, I do fear it.
================ CHUNK 1 ActTwoSceneTwo  ================

================ CHUNK 1 ActTwoSceneTwo  ================ 
  
 GUILDENSTERN 
 My honoured lord! 
 ROSENCRANTZ 
 My most dear lord! 
 HAMLET 
 My excellent good friends! 
 How dost thou, 
 Guildenstern? 
 Ah, 
 Rosencrantz! 
 Good lads, 
 how do you both? 
 ROSENCRANTZ 
 As the indifferent children of the earth. 
 GUILDENSTERN 
 Happy, 
 in that we are not overhappy; 
 On fortune's cap we are not the very button. 
 HAMLET 
 Nor the soles of her shoe? 
 ROSENCRANTZ 
 Neither, 
 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 Then you live about her waist, 
 or in the middle of her favours? 
 GUILDENSTERN 
 'Faith, 
 her privates we. 
 HAMLET 
 In the secret parts of fortune? 
 O, 
 most true; 
 she is a strumpet. 

================ CHUNK 1 ActThreeSceneOne  ================ 
  Act 3, Scene 1 
 ( place A room in the castle.) 
================ CHUNK 1 ActThreeSceneOne  ================ 
  
 HAMLET 
 To be, or not to be: that is the question: 
 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, 
 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 
 And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; 
 No more; and by a sleep to say we end 
 The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks 
 That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation 
 Devoutly to be wished.
================ CHUNK 1 ActThreeSceneTwo  ================

 HAMLET 
 Lady, 
 shall I lie in your lap? 
 ( action Lying down at Ophelia's feet.) 
 OPHELIA 
 No, 
 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 I mean, 
 my head upon your lap? 
 OPHELIA 
 Ay, 
 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 Do you think I meant country matters? 
 OPHELIA 
 I think nothing, 
 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs. 
 OPHELIA 
 What is, 
 my lord? 
 HAMLET 
 Nothing. 
 OPHELIA 
 You are merry, 
 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 Who, 
 I? 
 OPHELIA 
 Ay, 
 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 O God, 
 your only jig-maker. 
 What should a man do but be merry? 
 for, 
 look you, 
 how cheerfully my mother looks, 
 and my father died within's two hours. 
 OPHELIA 
 Nay, 
 'tis twice two months, 
 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 So long? 
 Nay then, 
 let the devil wear black, 
 for I'll have a suit of sables. 
 O heavens! 
 die two months ago, 
 and not forgotten yet! 
 Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year:

 Now, mother, what's the matter? 
 GERTRUDE 
 Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended. 
 HAMLET 
 Mother, you have my father much offended. 
 GERTRUDE 
 Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue. 
 HAMLET 
 Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue. 
 GERTRUDE 
 Why, how now, Hamlet! 
 HAMLET 
 What's the matter now? 
 GERTRUDE 
 Have you forgot me? 
 HAMLET 
 No, by the rood, not so: 
 You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife; 
 And - would it were not so! - you are my mother.

 GERTRUDE 
 How now, Ophelia! 
 ( voice Sings) 
 OPHELIA 
 How should I your true-love know 
 From another one? 
 By his cockle hat and staff, 
 And his sandal shoon. 
 GERTRUDE 
 Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song? 
 OPHELIA 
 Say you? nay, pray you, mark.

 HAMLET 
 Alas, 
 poor Yorick! 
 I knew him, 
 Horatio: 
 a fellow of infinite jest, 
 of most excellent fancy: 
 he hath bore me on his back a thousand times; 
 and now, 
 how abhorred in my imagination it is! 
 my gorge rises at it. 
 Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. 
 Where be your gibes now? 
 your gambols? 
 your songs? 
 your flashes of merriment, 
 that were wont to set the table on a roar? 

================ CHUNK 1 ActFiveSceneTwo  ================ 
  Act 5, Scene 2 
 ( place A hall in the castle.) 
 ( entrance Enter HAMLET and HORATIO.) 
================ CHUNK 1 ActFiveSceneTwo  ================ 
  
 HAMLET 
 O, I die, Horatio; 
 The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit: 
 I cannot live to hear the news from England; 
 But I do prophesy the election lights 
 On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice; 
 So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less, 
 Which have solicited. The rest is silence. 
 ( action Dies.) 
 HORATIO 
 Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince; 
 And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
