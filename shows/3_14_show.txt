 KING 
 Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death 
 The memory be green, and that it us befitted 
 To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom 
 To be contracted in one brow of woe, 
 Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature 
 That we with wisest sorrow think on him, 
 Together with remembrance of ourselves.
================ CHUNK 1   ================ 
  
 ( sound Flourish.) 
 ( exit Exeunt all but Hamlet.) 

================ CHUNK 1   ================ 
  
 HAMLET 
 O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, 
 Thaw and resolve itself into a dew! 
 Or that the Everlasting had not fixed 
 His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God! 
 How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, 
 Seem to me all the uses of this world! 
 Fie on't! ah fie!

  Act 1, Scene 3 
 ( place A room in Polonius' house.) 
 ( entrance Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA.) 
 LAERTES 
 My necessaries are embarked: farewell: 
 And, sister, as the winds give benefit 
 And convey is assistant, do not sleep, 
 But let me hear from you. 
 OPHELIA 
 Do you doubt that? 
 LAERTES 
 For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour, 
 Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, 
 A violet in the youth of primy nature, 
 Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, 
 The perfume and suppliance of a minute; 
 No more.

  Act 1, Scene 5 
 ( place Another part of the platform.) 
 ( entrance Enter GHOST and HAMLET.)

 Must render up myself.

 ( exit Exit Reynaldo.) 
 ( entrance Enter OPHELIA.) 

================ CHUNK 1 ActTwoSceneOne  ================ 
  
 OPHELIA 
 O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted! 
 POLONIUS 
 With what, i' the name of God? 
 OPHELIA 
 My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, 
 Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced; 
 No hat upon his head; his stockings fouled, 
 Ungartered, and down-gyved to his ankle; 
 Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other; 
 And with a look so piteous in purport 
 As if he had been loosed out of hell 
 To speak of horrors, he comes before me. 
 POLONIUS 
 Mad for thy love? 
 OPHELIA 
 My lord, I do not know; 
 But truly, I do fear it.

 GUILDENSTERN 
 My honoured lord! 
 ROSENCRANTZ 
 My most dear lord! 
 HAMLET 
 My excellent good friends! 
 How dost thou, 
 Guildenstern? 
 Ah, 
 Rosencrantz! 
 Good lads, 
 how do you both? 
 ROSENCRANTZ 
 As the indifferent children of the earth. 
 GUILDENSTERN 
 Happy, 
 in that we are not overhappy; 
 On fortune's cap we are not the very button. 
 HAMLET 
 Nor the soles of her shoe? 
 ROSENCRANTZ 
 Neither, 
 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 Then you live about her waist, 
 or in the middle of her favours? 
 GUILDENSTERN 
 'Faith, 
 her privates we. 
 HAMLET 
 In the secret parts of fortune? 
 O, 
 most true; 
 she is a strumpet. 

================ CHUNK 1 ActThreeSceneOne  ================ 
  Act 3, Scene 1 
 ( place A room in the castle.) 
================ CHUNK 1 ActThreeSceneOne  ================ 
  
 HAMLET 
 To be, or not to be: that is the question: 
 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, 
 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 
 And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; 
 No more; and by a sleep to say we end 
 The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks 
 That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation 
 Devoutly to be wished.

 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 I mean, 
 my head upon your lap? 
 OPHELIA 
 Ay, 
 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 Do you think I meant country matters? 
 OPHELIA 
 I think nothing, 
 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs. 
 OPHELIA 
 What is, 
 my lord? 
 HAMLET 
 Nothing. 
 OPHELIA 
 You are merry, 
 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 Who, 
 I?

 And that your grace hath screened and stood between 
 Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.

 OPHELIA 
 How should I your true-love know 
 From another one? 
 By his cockle hat and staff, 
 And his sandal shoon.

 I tell thee she is; 
 therefore make her grave straight: 
 the crowner hath sat on her, 
 and finds it Christian burial. 
 FIRST_CLOWN 
 How can that be, 
 unless she drowned herself in her own defence?

 Why, 
 'tis found so.

 HAMLET 
 O, I die, Horatio; 
 The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit: 
 I cannot live to hear the news from England; 
 But I do prophesy the election lights 
 On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice; 
 So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less, 
 Which have solicited. The rest is silence.

HAMLET
O, wonderful!
KING
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
KING
O Gertrude, Gertrude,  When sorrows come, they come not single spies,  But in battalions.
HAMLET
O, the recorders! let me see one.
OPHELIA
O ho!
GERTRUDE
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
HAMLET
O villainy! Ho!
POLONIUS
O, give me leave:  How does my good Lord Hamlet?
GERTRUDE
O me, what hast thou done?
FIRST_CLOWN
O, a pit of clay for to be made  For such a guest is meet.
GERTRUDE
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
HAMLET
O God!
KING
O Gertrude, come away!
GERTRUDE
O, speak to me no more;
HAMLET
O most pernicious woman!
KING
O, for two special reasons;
HORATIO
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
GHOST
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power  So to seduce!
LAERTES
O heat, dry up my brains!
=================== CHUNK 1 itfilter  scene_pause:1 ================
HAMLET
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
HORATIO
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:  Here's yet some liquor left.
HAMLET
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
HAMLET
I am tame, sir: pronounce.
LAERTES
I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
HAMLET
I am glad to see you well:  Horatio, or I do forget myself.
HAMLET
I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
LAERTES
I am justly killed with mine own treachery.
HAMLET
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
HAMLET
I am sure you make a wanton of me.
HAMLET
I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
=================== CHUNK 1 itfilter  scene_pause:1 ================
HAMLET
I will.
HAMLET
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
POLONIUS
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:  Mad call I it;
GERTRUDE
I will not speak with her.
POLONIUS
I will say so.
HAMLET
I will go pray.
CAPTAIN
I will do't, my lord.
REYNALDO
I will, my lord.
POLONIUS
I will take my leave of you.
GERTRUDE
I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
LAERTES
I will do't:  And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
HAMLET
I will requite your loves.
HAMLET
I will watch to-night;

HAMLET
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
OPHELIA
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
KING
I do not fear it;

I do beseech you.
LAERTES
I do receive your offered love like love,  And will not wrong it.
PLAYER_KING
I do believe you think what now you speak;
POLONIUS
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
KING
I do not think't.

You are the most immediate to our throne;
OPHELIA
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
OPHELIA
You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
OPHELIA
You are merry, my lord.

You are welcome.
OPHELIA
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.

Thou pray'st not well.
MARCELLUS
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
HAMLET
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
HAMLET
Thou know'st already.
POLONIUS
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
GERTRUDE
Thou turn'st my eyes into my very soul;
KING
Thou still hast been the father of good news.

BERNARDO
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.

It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the players ready?
HORATIO
It was, as I have seen it in his life,  A sable silvered.
=================== CHUNK 1 itfilter  scene_pause:1 ================
HAMLET

KING
It is the poisoned cup: it is too late.
LAERTES
It is a poison tempered by himself.
OSRIC
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
HORATIO
It is a nipping and an eager air.
LAERTES
It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
MARCELLUS
It is offended.
POLONIUS
It is backed like a weasel.
LAERTES
It is our trick;
HAMLET
It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.

ROSENCRANTZ
Then thus she says; your behaviour hath struck her into amazement and admiration.

Then up he rose, and donned his clothes,  And dupped the chamber-door;
HAMLET
Then saw you not his face?
HAMLET
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
HAMLET
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?
HAMLET
Then, venom, to thy work.
HAMLET
Then I would you were so honest a man.
OPHELIA
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;

OPHELIA

HAMLET
No, not I;
HORATIO
No, by no means.
