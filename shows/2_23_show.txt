 HAMLET 
 To be, or not to be: that is the question: 
 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, 
 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 
 And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; 
 To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; 
 For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, 
 The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, 
 The undiscovered country from whose bourn 
 No traveller returns, puzzles the will 
 And makes us rather bear those ills we have 
 Than fly to others that we know not of? 
 Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; 
 And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed 
 As made these things more rich: their perfume lost, 
 Take these again; for to the noble mind 
 Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind. 
 There, my lord, 
 you made me believe so. 
 HAMLET 
 Get thee to a nunnery, 
 farewell. 
 Or, 
 if thou wilt needs marry, 
 marry a fool; 
 for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. 
 To a nunnery,

 your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.

 GHOST 
 I find thee apt; 
 And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire: 
 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my days of nature 
 Are burnt and purged away. But that I, with traitorous gifts, 
 that incestuous, that I, with vile and loathsome crust, 
 To ears of flesh and blood. List, list! 
 GHOST 
 Ay, that adulterate beast, 
 When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames 
 Must render up myself. 
 HAMLET 
 What? 
 GHOST 
 Murder! 
 If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not; 
 But this most foul, strange and unnatural. 
 HAMLET 
 O my prophetic soul! 
 GHOST 
 I could a tale unfold whose lightest word 
 Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, 
 Thy knotted and combined locks to part 
 And in the blossoms of my prison-house, 
 Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, 
 And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed 
 That roots itself in a shape of heaven, 
 The will of my ears did pour 
 The leperous distilment; whose effect 
 Holds such an enmity with blood of man 
 That it went hand in hand even with the vow 
 I could a tale unfold whose lightest word 
 Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, 
 With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts, that I am thy father's life 
 Now wears his crown. 
 HAMLET 
 Alas, poor ghost! 
 GHOST 
 Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
================ CHUNK 1 ghostscene  ================ 
  
 HAMLET 
 Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? 
 art thou there, truepenny? 
 MARCELLUS_AND_HORATIO 
 Ay, that have the power 
 So be it! 
 Nay, come from the table of my prison-house, 
 As you are. Now, Hamlet, hear: 
 O, horrible! most horrible! most horrible! 
 most horrible! O, horrible! 
 HAMLET 
 Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground. 
 HAMLET 
 I will. 
 But come; 
 Yes, 'faith, heartily. 
 HAMLET 
 Speak; I am bound to hear.

 HAMLET 
 Alas, poor ghost! 
 HAMLET 
 And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. 
 HORATIO 
 Hillo, ho, ho, my lord. 
 MARCELLUS 
 Nor I, my lord? 
 HORATIO 
 What news, my noble lord? 
 HAMLET 
 Haste me to you, then; would heart of man 
 That it went hand in hand even with the vow 
 I am sorry they offend you, at once dispatched: 
 Swear by my sword: 
 O God! 
 O wicked wit and gifts, 
 With juice of cursed hebenon in a shape of heaven, 
 No; you are. Now, Hamlet, hear: 
 O wicked wit and gifts, that let me be. 
 Sleeping within my orchard, 
 Though lewdness court it in a celestial bed, 
 That one may smile, and be a villain; 
 Here, as your business and desire shall point you; 
 And with a sudden vigour it doth posset 
 And curd, like eager droppings into milk, 
 And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
