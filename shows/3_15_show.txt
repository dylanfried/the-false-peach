 KING 
 Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death 
 The memory be green, and that it us befitted 
 To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom 
 To be contracted in one brow of woe, 
 Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature 
 That we with wisest sorrow think on him, 
 Together with remembrance of ourselves.
================ CHUNK 1   ================ 
  
 ( sound Flourish.) 
 ( exit Exeunt all but Hamlet.) 

================ CHUNK 1   ================ 
  
 HAMLET 
 O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, 
 Thaw and resolve itself into a dew! 
 Or that the Everlasting had not fixed 
 His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God! 
 How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, 
 Seem to me all the uses of this world! 
 Fie on't! ah fie!
================ CHUNK 1 ActOneSceneThree  ================ 
  Act 1, Scene 3 
 ( place A room in Polonius' house.) 
 ( entrance Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA.) 
 LAERTES 
 My necessaries are embarked: farewell: 
 And, sister, as the winds give benefit 
 And convey is assistant, do not sleep, 
 But let me hear from you. 
 OPHELIA 
 Do you doubt that? 
 LAERTES 
 For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour, 
 Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, 
 A violet in the youth of primy nature, 
 Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, 
 The perfume and suppliance of a minute; 
 No more.
================ CHUNK 1 ActOneSceneFive  ================ 
  Act 1, Scene 5 
 ( place Another part of the platform.) 
 ( entrance Enter GHOST and HAMLET.) 
 HAMLET 
 Whither wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further. 
 GHOST

 Must render up myself.

 ( entrance Enter OPHELIA.) 

================ CHUNK 1 ActTwoSceneOne  ================ 
  
 OPHELIA 
 O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted! 
 POLONIUS 
 With what, i' the name of God? 
 OPHELIA 
 My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, 
 Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced; 
 No hat upon his head; his stockings fouled, 
 Ungartered, and down-gyved to his ankle; 
 Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other; 
 And with a look so piteous in purport 
 As if he had been loosed out of hell 
 To speak of horrors, he comes before me. 
 POLONIUS 
 Mad for thy love? 
 OPHELIA 
 My lord, I do not know; 
 But truly, I do fear it.

 GUILDENSTERN 
 My honoured lord! 
 ROSENCRANTZ 
 My most dear lord! 
 HAMLET 
 My excellent good friends! 
 How dost thou, 
 Guildenstern? 
 Ah, 
 Rosencrantz! 
 Good lads, 
 how do you both? 
 ROSENCRANTZ 
 As the indifferent children of the earth. 
 GUILDENSTERN 
 Happy, 
 in that we are not overhappy; 
 On fortune's cap we are not the very button. 
 HAMLET 
 Nor the soles of her shoe? 
 ROSENCRANTZ 
 Neither, 
 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 Then you live about her waist, 
 or in the middle of her favours? 
 GUILDENSTERN 
 'Faith, 
 her privates we. 
 HAMLET 
 In the secret parts of fortune? 
 O, 
 most true; 
 she is a strumpet. 

================ CHUNK 1 ActThreeSceneOne  ================ 
  Act 3, Scene 1 
 ( place A room in the castle.) 
================ CHUNK 1 ActThreeSceneOne  ================ 
  
 HAMLET 
 To be, or not to be: that is the question: 
 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, 
 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 
 And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; 
 No more; and by a sleep to say we end 
 The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks 
 That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation 
 Devoutly to be wished.
================ CHUNK 1 ActThreeSceneTwo  ================

 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 I mean, 
 my head upon your lap? 
 OPHELIA 
 Ay, 
 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 Do you think I meant country matters? 
 OPHELIA 
 I think nothing, 
 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs. 
 OPHELIA 
 What is, 
 my lord? 
 HAMLET 
 Nothing. 
 OPHELIA 
 You are merry, 
 my lord. 
 HAMLET 
 Who, 
 I? 
 OPHELIA 
 Ay, 
 my lord.

 O God,

 ( place The Queen's closet.) 
 ( entrance Enter QUEEN and POLONIUS.) 
 POLONIUS 
 'A will come straight. Look you lay home to him: 
 Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with, 
 And that your grace hath screened and stood between 
 Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here. 
 Pray you, be round.

 I'll warrant you, fear me not.

 GERTRUDE 
 How now, Ophelia! 
 ( voice Sings) 
 OPHELIA 
 How should I your true-love know 
 From another one? 
 By his cockle hat and staff, 
 And his sandal shoon. 
 GERTRUDE 
 Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

 Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully seeks her own salvation? 
 SECOND_CLOWN 
 I tell thee she is; 
 therefore make her grave straight: 
 the crowner hath sat on her, 
 and finds it Christian burial. 
 FIRST_CLOWN 
 How can that be, 
 unless she drowned herself in her own defence? 
 SECOND_CLOWN 
 Why, 
 'tis found so.

 ( entrance Enter HAMLET and HORATIO.) 
================ CHUNK 1 ActFiveSceneTwo  ================ 
  
 HAMLET 
 O, I die, Horatio; 
 The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit: 
 I cannot live to hear the news from England; 
 But I do prophesy the election lights 
 On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice; 
 So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less, 
 Which have solicited. The rest is silence. 
 ( action Dies.) 
 HORATIO

 And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!

 That can I;

 Whose image even but now appeared to us, 
 Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, 
 Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride, 
 Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet 
 For so this side of our known world esteemed him 
 Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a sealed compact, 
 Well ratified by law and heraldry, 
 Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands 
 Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror: 
 Against the which, a moiety competent 
 Was gaged by our king; which had returned 
 To the inheritance of Fortinbras, 
 Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same comart, 
 And carriage of the article designed, 
 His fell to Hamlet.
